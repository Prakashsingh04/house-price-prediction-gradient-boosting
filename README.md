# house-price-prediction-gradient-boosting
In this project, i have built a house price prediction system using Gradient 
Boosting, focusing on properties in Bengaluru. starting by cleaning and 
preparing the data—removing unnecessary columns, handling missing 
values, and converting textual data into useful numeric formats. 
After that, i have  used one-hot encoding to deal with categorical variables. 
The model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 
20%, giving us a good starting R² score of 0.67.  
To make the model even better, i have used GridSearchCV for 
hyperparameter tuning, which improved the accuracy further to an R² of 
0.70 also visualized the model's performance and tested it on a sample 
input to show how it would work in the real world.
